Let's go home.
It was always my dream to...
What are you talking about?
What exactly are you up to, boss?
..until we starved.
Good morning, Mr Solomon.
Thomas, thought we could trust each other.
Sparkplug is on his way up.
- I could...
It was way more than just having a good time.
Oh, God, what's he doing now?
Although unconfirmed, this historic turn of events seems to be motivated by today's attack on the White House which began as the Prime Minister of Korea was meeting with President Asher.
I wanted to spend the rest of my life here.
He said I don't get paid if you show up drunk.
That's...
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
And now tell me we haven't missed that commie cunt Billings.
- Why not? !
HAVE YOU SEEN A RED CAR GO BY HERE, FAST?
Sh...
Duke!
Fucking look at that.
What's the damn point?
LET'S GET THE SAT-NAV.
Can you decrypt?
I knew her so well.
I don't care what you tell him.
- Where are we even going?
I'm tired of being taken for a fucking douche.
They destroyed our moon and with that, half the planet.
One of them found Beth.
I love you so much, Mom.
I'm sorry, I can't remember.
Yeah, this is Carol.
116.
That without her you will die.
Just feast your fucking eyes!
I know where you are.
Before WCKD she was all I had.
Market Street Power Plant.
YEAH, WHEN YA...
I think you've forgotten I don't work here any more.
I'll see you Saturday.
Professor, I am having trouble completing the boot up.
Don't you get it yet, TARS?
Get me some Falstaff.
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets both orbit it.
..listening to you breathe.
They're letters, love letters from-- from some woman.
It's a Turkish bath house in the French Quarter?
- But stuck down here on Earth?
Who's looking for me?
- Shift 3!
I don't have anything...
Sir, they've also assassinated the South Korean Prime Minister.
I'm going to get to you.
..is to keep testing your limits.
How cold it is!
Command, Tiger Flight's three minutes out.
Yes! I won't let you down, boss.
YOU'VE ONLY GOT ONE LEFT.
NO, I'M DONE.
It ain't about what she did.
But he can't move until we're all in position.
..that it's not from this world, Clark.
A14, A1.
Pass me the wood, I'll make a fire.
You won't get anything from me.
Killed for less.
You fucking kidding me?
- Shall we?
Scientists, explorers.
Sir, we have a hot feed from the P.E.O.C.
- Not with me.
Do you have kids?
"She Went Down Without a Fight."
Don't give a damn.
Where the hell did they find you, greenhorn?
Look what I found.
Are you saying I might not get paid for this?
Glad everything's working out okay for you.
And I can't tell you what it is.
How'd you know he was here?
I'll drop her at the library and head to the office.
Just try and relax.
- MMM.
9.38 PLEASE.
Don't need to look at the size of a man.
You have to be mine.
This is serious, Lois.

We cannot survive here.
You don't look fine.
Simon, the plan was simple.
I forgot the salad.
Come here, puss. Damn, baby.
Ah, shit.
You give your statement?
All right, let's talk in my office.
Guess I'll just have to trust you.
Vika, she's a flight officer.
We're on 24 hour lock down here.
But it's not all bad news.
Come in here!
He's coming, Murph!

Hello, Mr Swan?
- Yeah, you can stop shitting your pants now.
Thank you...
You're bound to find something.
I'm digging!
IT'S NOT THE PHONE.
I know where he hides the keys.
You got a boyfriend?
What did someone say that could convince you?
- Talk!
- Is that?
Give me that now.
- Lazarus came back from the dead.
You're a monster, Zod..

Cross town...
- She seems okay.
..doesn't it?
I don't know exactly what you think you saw or heard... but you have to calm down, okay?
Voilà.
I can't protect you.
You must have put it somewhere.
My wife was terrified.
She asked.

Yeah, we were.
THEY GOT HIS D.N.A. FROM SALIVA ON HIS SKI MASK.
Oh, hey.
What's in the wardrobe, Simon?
Misses his buddy though.
That's their advantage.
It's for you.
Please stop doing that.
We'll be there.
- You guys are 50 crazy.
YOU GO YOUR WAY.
Flight 418 now boarding at gate seven.

I miss you a lot, dad.
This...
Good morning.

..if they knew there was someone like this out there?
She shoulda had them in school.
This all started with a visit from our friendly neighbourhood loan shark.
..where have you sent him?
- Not much traffic.
We have to tell the sheriff.
Well, it was my daddy's.
There are millions of people suffering out there.
I'm looking for a Pete Ross.
I went to the lawyer...
- Where did you find those coordinates?
That's so cute.
He's with a patient.

You dodged a bullet.
Oh, oh, first I'm gonna need to see...
- What's wrong?
Sit down, Finney!
WHAT DO YOU CALL HIM THEN?
And she found the car keys.
Yeah. Golf's all about etiquette for me.
It's our people's only hope.
ALL:
Right, here's what you're going to do.
You shouldn't be here.
When were you going to tell me this?
In fact, everything got upgraded, our suits, the office furniture... we even had prototype car phones fitted.
We tracked them as far as the mountains.
Okay, asshole.

That's on the other side of town.
Don't shit your pants, it's all above board.
He's here.
At the hospital?
We need to think of time as a resource, just like oxygen and food.
I agreed to take Robbie on his school trip.
- That guy whose wallet...
No, my name is Charles Ruchowski.
Can't be the pills.
It happens towards the end of the day.
I do... every day.

You could declare bankruptcy, a lot of people do that.
-Lynne!
Jack, we were here.
Give it to me straight.
Come on, do you want to die?
She's..
I earned it, hard work.
It's written on your faces.

To our potential success.
For believing in me.
You're under contract.

I will pull the trigger.
You can't die.

I think we should wait.
That's one way of looking at it.
I would like to speak to Lois Lane.
He could've killed us, but he didn't.
You see, it came over the wire that Ellen had died.

You think you can threaten my mother?
Like running for president.
I've gotta get back to the room.
Now that makes you the responsible party.
[ SIZZLING ]
As in pay any tax.
What the fuck y'all waiting for?
We just started setting them.
It's that you get to give a little something back.
Dude!
Just don't get too smart.

Everybody loved her.
You know?
Wow, we've never won anything before.
Try to hold still.
You know.

'Cause you know what they teach me?
Yes, we see this on occasion.
We got another problem.

Ouch. You okay?
Where are we going?
We could have built a new Krypton in this squalor.
Good morning, Sally.
Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt.
You speak French?
You were right.
When in doubt --try something traditional.
Is that your plan?
Quite sure of that, are you?

I quickly managed to get Ronnie Farrell onside by making him an offer he couldn't refuse.
Take him away.
The G.I. Joes clearly went beyond the boundaries of their mission.
